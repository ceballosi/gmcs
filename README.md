# GMC Django app 

## Backgound

Its annoying having this info in LabKey and [Confluence](https://cnfl.extge.co.uk/display/GELDAMS/ODS+Codes+PLUS+CIPs) which are not easily accessible.

Lets make another copy :( 

## Purpose

To put the GMC and LDP infomation into a small (sqlite) database accessible via the Django admin interface which can be run locally.


## How (TBC)

- Clone the repo
- Create virtualenv
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python manage.py runserver
- navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- username: fsanger password: ACGTACGT
